<h1>        Week one Results: NC State big win over Colorado, Defending champs pressured</h1>
<pre>
      <div style="font-size:20px;font-family:Times New Roman">

            Week one of the CCL fall season has begun! It all started on Tuesday with NC State facing off against Colorado Boulder and this match was intense. Captains WUMPERNUGGET and Wet0 (for each team respectively)
          played really well for both teams, as CU got the first win of the three game series, but then an unexpected face took over. IAmArch, a relatively unknown player, really stepped up for the Wolfpack.
          IAmArch netted 22 goals, 2 assists and 16 KO's to push NC State to a massive week 1 win, but he wasnt the only rookie. CU's rookie performed quite well too. Aejjee netted 11 goals and led CU in redirects in
          all three games. These rookies are next in line for both of these teams in the future and hopefully they can keep up these kinds of performances later on in the season.

            Now onto wednesdays events. Yesterdays stream on the OdysseyInteractive twitch channel with a battle for Canada, featuring a new team: York University out of Ontario, facing off agaisnt UAlberta.
          UAlberta stomped the newcomers 2-0 while only giving up 5 goals. Then comes OSU Black vs UCF Rogs where OSU sweep UCF 2-0 behind very strong play from Zunicore and PeanutEnjoyer, scoring 12 and 10 goals
          respectively. The team only gave up 2 sets with 14 goals total, dominating a decently strong UCF team. Now for the main event of the evening, defending champs UCLA vs UTD. UCLA was expected to win since
          Snake for UTD didn't play, but UTD still put up a fight. The first set went to set 5 with UCLA's Grimella getting the game winning goal, having 5 goals, 3 assists and 205 redirects in game one.
          It was a whole different story for game two, UCLA looked like they had somewhere to be and smashed UTD, only allowing 2 goals, both coming from CloakOak, as the defending champs finish off strong.

            Here are the rest of the results from wednesday: UNC-CH, a new team here in the CCL, beats TeamRPI 2-0, Oso Esports beat UTulsa 2-0, York Spartans beating OSU Orange 2-1, Texas State beats
      Fanshawe Academy 2-0. GCU Steves beat RIT White 2-0, RIT Orange beat St. Clair 2-1. The main team from Fanshawe, the Fuel, beat Texas Tech Black 2-0.

            Breaking news from Thursday: GMU smashes WVSS 2-0 while only giving up 7 goals across both games. Vega, the forward for GMU, scored 12 goals for the Patriots, as GMU start their quest for glory off
          strong against another playoff team.

        With some games to still be played, the new CCL season has started off strong, and it will only keep getting better. Stay tuned for updates from the CCL!
